# Burger

### Description

This repository contains a Burger application which allows a user to input the names of burgers that they would like to eat and the names of burgers that they have eaten. Each burger the user inputs, is stored in a database. When the user clicks on the "Devoured" or "Not Devoured" buttons, the database is updated and the burger is moved to the opposite list. Burgers can also be deleted from each list and therefore from the database.

This application utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, and ORM following an MVC design pattern.
